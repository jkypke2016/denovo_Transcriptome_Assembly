# *De-novo* Transcriptome Assembly

 **This repository contains all steps (including scripts) needed to de-novo assemble transcriptomes from raw reads.**
 
## Overview
 
 Two different _de-novo_ transcriptome assemblers are compared:
 * [Trinity] (https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq/wiki) 
 * [SOAPdenovo-Trans] (https://sourceforge.net/projects/soapdenovotrans/files/SOAPdenovo-Trans/)    

Raw reads are assembled with and without using available trimming options.  
Quality checks are performed after successful assembly.
